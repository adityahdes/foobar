# Google Foobar Challenge

### Please do not look at the code in this repo if you are attempting or plan on attempting the challenge!

This is just a place for me to store my solutions.
Attempt #1 was done in Java, but I failed to get the correct solution before the
time limit expired for part 5. Attempt #2 is in progress (albeit paused
indefinitely due to me being more busy with school), and I have decided to work
in Python this time.
